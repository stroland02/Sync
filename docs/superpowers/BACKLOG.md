# Sync backlog

The queue an autonomous tick pulls from. Ordered by what unblocks the most, not by
size. When a tick has nothing else to do, it takes the topmost unclaimed item, dispatches
a worker against it, and moves the item to **In flight** with the task id.

An item is only **Done** once it is on `main` with all three gates green
(`uv run pytest`, `uv run lint-imports` unredirected, `uv run python scripts/lint_encoding.py src tests`).

Every item states what is wrong, why it matters, and what evidence would close it. An
item that cannot say what evidence closes it is not ready to dispatch.

## Ready

### B7 — The M0 acceptance run has not executed since the pipeline changed underneath it

`tests/test_e2e_stripe.py::test_one_command_produces_one_green_pull_request` is the
milestone's definition of done and it is `@pytest.mark.e2e`, deselected by default, so
nothing in CI or in any worker's gates has exercised it. Since it last ran the pipeline
gained: the tier cascade, the property-omit codemod, a push guard over the discarded-commit
range, branch deletion on abandonment, checkpoint serialiser registration, the
dependency-edit guard, staged-new-file support, and dependency-tree discarding. Every one of
those sits on the acceptance path.

Checked cheaply and it is not obviously broken: the test still collects, and the production
graph compiles with the real `StripeAdapter`, `TypeScriptAdapter`, `TieredRemediator`,
`GitHubForge` and store, exposing all eight nodes. That establishes the wiring survived. It
establishes nothing about behaviour.

**Run it with `-n0`.** `addopts` now carries `-n auto`, which applies to the e2e test too.

**This one is not a worker's to run unattended.** It opens a pull request on a real GitHub
repository and spends `xhigh` model time on the patch agent. It needs a human to decide
when, which is why it is recorded here rather than dispatched.

**Closes when:** one `sync run` produces a CI-green pull request again, or the failure is
recorded with which change broke it.

### B21 — An existing database never gains a new column

`GraphStore.apply_schema` executes `schema.sql`, which is `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
throughout with **zero** `ALTER TABLE` statements. Against a database that already has the
tables it is a no-op, so a column added later never appears. Two have shipped this way:
`call_site.loop_depth` and `finding.claim`.

The failure lands at runtime on the first insert naming the missing column, and the message
names a column rather than a missing migration — so whoever meets it debugs the wrong thing.

Nothing catches it because `conftest` creates a fresh database per run, so every test starts
from a schema built in one pass, which is exactly the case that works.

**Closes when:** a test builds a database from a schema missing a column, runs `apply_schema`,
and inserts a row using that column successfully — failing against the current code.

## In flight

- **B21** — `task_375ac7413ad1`.

## Done

- The conformance kit now covers four of five protocols, with 29 rules each proved to fire.
  Landed via `fc7090f`. It found the finding-collision defect below.
- `Finding.claim` joins the natural key, so three detectors stop overwriting themselves.
  Landed `c88f240`. Reproducing first revealed a second, unnamed axis in efficiency that a
  key-only fix would have turned from silent loss into a flood of rows.
- The indexer takes the SDK package from the vendor adapter rather than a module constant,
  delivered by the other coordinator's workers; `symbol_root` followed after a scoped-package
  defect that no fixture could see.

- An MCP vendor adapter, M3's last unstarted item. Landed via `28b0772`.
- The status-rate detector, M2's missing half. Landed via `28b0772`. It reports a *level* rather
  than a change, because `cli.py` truncates `observed_call` every run so "earlier" means earlier
  within one ingested window — and said so rather than quoting a trend it does not have.
- A language axis on the binding path. Landed `19834b6`.
- Efficiency findings state that a cost is shared across call sites rather than counted once
  each. Landed `0f980da`.
- The plugin SDK conformance kit and authoring guide. Landed `bb425ba`. Running it against the
  real adapters disproved one of its own rules within a minute.
- The orchestration archive: 147 worker reports, escalations and decisions, exported before the
  terminals were cleaned up. Landed `aef675a`.

- A language axis on the binding path. Landed `19834b6`. Every Twilio map key is snake_case
  (`twilio-python`), so a TypeScript call site could never resolve and failed silently. A
  mismatched spelling now refuses rather than being rewritten into a match. Written by the
  coordinator after the dispatched worker never started.

- The efficiency detector, M1's second half. Landed via `cb0ee3e`. Three findings — calls in a
  loop, uncached repeats, retry storms — and deliberately **no dollar figure**: a call count is
  a fact, a cost needs a price per call no table here holds.
- Loop context on `call_site`. Landed `e8076be`. A depth rather than a flag, counting array
  callbacks alongside loop statements. Written by the coordinator after two dispatched attempts
  had their work destroyed in shared worktrees.

- The M1 span store: `observed_call`, OTLP ingest, and correlation behind a `RequestCorrelator`
  protocol. Landed `ecab0bd`. Grain is one row per trace — per unit of work — which is what lets
  a loop be told apart from ordinary traffic, and what makes ingest idempotent with no counter.
- A second vendor adapter (Twilio), the first real second implementation of
  `operation_for_symbol`. Landed `14394e4`. It inverted the assumption the symbol map was built
  around; the design document now records it.

- Run the suite in parallel, one database per worker. Landed `b590a5e`. Measured **2.18x** on
  an idle 12-core machine, not the 3.0x first reported — that baseline was taken while other
  workers were running. The load-bearing find was `conftest` returning early on a set
  `SYNC_DSN`, which put all twelve workers on one database and deadlocked them on `TRUNCATE`.
- Discard a dependency tree the previous finding doctored. Landed `0fd1623`. Written by the
  coordinator after three dispatches to a worker failed to start.

- Let a patch ship a file it had to create. Landed `aeecde4`, with the install-mark fix at
  `12f9dc9`. Staging is the agent's assertion that the patch needs the file; untracked
  debris stays excluded because neither `git add -u` nor `git diff HEAD` reads it.
- Catch a patch that edited an installed dependency instead of the source. Landed `a891f65`.
  The cheap path guard's reasoning held but its mechanism did not — git cannot answer the
  question either way — so it compares filesystem mtimes instead. Residual recorded as B6.
- Refuse a push that would discard any non-Sync commit, not merely one at the tip. Landed
  `7adeb08`. The worker found a case the brief missed: a stranger's commit the push carries
  forward is not at risk, so refusing it would abandon findings needlessly.

- Register `sync.core` types with LangGraph's checkpoint serialiser. Landed `05c11f5`.
  The warning is read-side only and nothing fell back to pickle — the brief was wrong about
  that and the worker corrected it. Future failure returns a raw dict silently.

- Derive the SDK verb from `spec3.sdk.json`'s `x-stableId` rather than the URL shape.
  Landed `b289a9e`. Coverage unmoved at 105 of 414; one symbol corrected.
- Refuse a push lease against a tip Sync did not author; delete the branch an abandoned
  finding leaves behind. Landed `38ec2c7` and wired at `9627f65`.
- Run the tier cascade and give it the change class the acceptance run hit.
